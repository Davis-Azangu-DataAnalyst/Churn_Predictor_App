# Churn Prediction Web App

This project aims to build a web application for churn prediction using Streamlit. The web app allows users to input customer information and receive churn predictions based on a trained machine learning model. Churn prediction is an important task for businesses as it helps them identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions or stop using their services. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and minimize revenue loss.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will build a churn prediction web app using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for users to input customer information, process the input data, and display churn predictions generated by a trained machine learning models(KNN amd Logistic Regression models).

## Data

The dataset used to train the churn prediction model is provided in the `Data` directory. It consists of a CSV file named `final_df.csv`, which contains the following columns:

1. `SeniorCitizen`: Whether a customer is a senior citizen or not (Yes, No)
2. `Partner`: Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No)
3. `Dependents`: Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No)
4. `Tenure`: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
5. `PhoneService`: Whether the customer has a phone service or not (Yes, No)
6. `MultipleLines`: Whether the customer has multiple lines or not
7. `InternetService`: Customer's internet service provider (DSL, Fiber Optic, No)
8. `OnlineSecurity`: Whether the customer has online security or not (Yes, No, No Internet)
9. `OnlineBackup`: Whether the customer has online backup or not (Yes, No, No Internet)
10. `DeviceProtection`: Whether the customer has device protection or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
11. `TechSupport`: Whether the customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet)
12. `StreamingTV`: Whether the customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
13. `StreamingMovies`: Whether the customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No Internet service)
14. `Contract`: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-Month, One year, Two year)
15. `PaperlessBilling`: Whether the customer has paperless billing or not (Yes, No)
16. `PaymentMethod`: The customer's payment method (Electronic check, mailed check, Bank transfer(automatic), Credit card(automatic))
17. `MonthlyCharges`: The amount charged to the customer monthly
18. `TotalCharges`: The total amount charged to the customer

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/Davis-Azangu-DataAnalyst/Churn_Predictor_App.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd churn-predictor-app`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the churn prediction web app, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have installed the required dependencies (see [Installation](#installation)).
2. Prepare your input data in the same format as the provided dataset.
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run 01_Home.py`
4. The web app will start running locally, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8503`.

## Model Training

wo best performing models (KNN and Logistic Regression models) were selected from my previous project. From this repository: [https://github.com/Davis-Azangu-DataAnalyst/Classification-Project-LP2](https://github.com/Davis-Azangu-DataAnalyst/Classification-Project-LP2)
 process of training the churn prediction model is described in detail in the `model_training.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and model training using various machine learning algorithms.

## Web App

The Streamlit web app is implemented in the `app.py` file. It utilizes the trained churn prediction model to make predictions based on user input. The app provides a user interface where users can enter customer information and receive churn predictions instantly.
